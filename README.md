## What is this
These are my dotfiles. I recommend you stay as far as humanly possible from them.
If they confuse you, then that's because they are confusing. My dotfiles are a mess, refer to what i said earlier.
If you want to learn something, your best bet is to stay far, far away from my dotfile repositories.
In here, you'll find an absolutely unnecessarily complex NixOS setup, and a bunch of other stuff.
If you're still reading this, then you are either very stubborn, or very interested in looking at a piece of my shit setup. In that case... good luck.
